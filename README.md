ABSTRACT
There are many variables that affect the price of a home. With this project, the goal was to explore data that leads to the creation of a predictive model. This model would then be able to tell homebuyers and other interested parties what features to pay attention in a home in regard to price.

The primary feature analyzed for the model was ‘furnishingstatus.’ Other features with high positive correlation were also utilized, and overall, the process resulted in a model that is roughly accurate 50% of the time. While there is much opportunity for improvement, this is definitely a good place to start if someone is interested in learning more about what variables affect housing prices the most.
